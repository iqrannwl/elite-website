## 🎯 Usage Pattern

All form templates follow the same pattern:
1. ✅ Extends base template
2. ✅ Header with title and back button
3. ✅ Error display
4. ✅ Form fields in organized sections
5. ✅ Cancel and Submit buttons
6. ✅ Responsive design
7. ✅ Bootstrap styling

## 📋 Next Steps

To complete the system, I need to:
1. Create views for all forms
2. Add URLs for all operations
3. Update all templates to remove admin links
4. Connect forms to their respective list pages

Would you like me to continue with creating the views and URLs?
